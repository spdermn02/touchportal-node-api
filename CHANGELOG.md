# Touch Portal Node API - Change Log

## v4.0.0
  ### New Features: 
  - Developers may now initiate a plugin update check at any time using the `checkForUpdate` function from TPClient
    - Allows option to include pre-releases from github allowing users to decide to download alpha/beta versions ([#44])

  ### Changes
  - `TPClient.Connect` no longer accepts `updateUrl` to initate a github update check upon plugin connect.
  - `TPClient.checkForUpdate` now takes the args `githubUser`, `githubRepo` and `includePrerelease`
    - Example: `TPClient.checkForUpdate("spdermn02", "TouchPortal_Discord_Plugin", includePrerelease)`

## v3.3.0
  ### New Features:
  - Allow plugin "stateful" disconnection/exit ([#36]):
    - Added `exitOnClose` option to `connect()` method to control if client automatically calls `process.exit(0)` upon socket error/close (default is `true`).
    - Added `disconnected` event with `hadError <boolean>` parameter passed on from socket's `close` event (`true` if the socket had a transmission error).
    - Added `socketError` event with `err <Error>` parameter passed on from socket's `error` event.
    - Added `disconnect()` method which closes any current connection with `socket.end()`.
  -  Logging output can now be directed to a custom callback function instead of `console.log()` or disabled entirely (see PR [#38] for details):

  ### Fixes
  - Fixed handling of incoming messages from TP when the complete data could not fit into the client socket's buffer at the same time. This could happen on very long messages (with lots of data in an action), or when messages get queued in the operating system's buffer w/out being read, for example when plugin is paused in debugger or otherwise spends a long time being unresponsive. ([#40])

  ### Changes
  - `TouchPortalClient` constructor now accepts an optional `options` object argument with the following properties:
    - `pluginId` - Can be specified here instead of in the `connect()` method.
    - `captureRejections` - Passed through to `EventEmitter`.
    - `logCallback` - Can be a callback function or `null` to disable logging (see PR [#38] for details).
  - An exception is now thrown (and logged) if `pluginId` is empty when `connect()` is invoked. ([#38])
  - `removeState()` no longer validates that the state exists before sending the command to TP (allows removing states after a plugin restart, for example). ([#33])
  - `choiceUpdate()` and `choiceUpdateSpecific()` now allow sending an empty array of choices. ([#34])
  - `logIt()` method now allows direct passthrough of object to `console.log()` (or configured callback) without strignifying anything explicitly. ([#32])
  - Minor performance improvements whith reading and writing socket data strings. ([#31], [#40])

  ### Package
  - GitHub URL can now be used as a _package.json_ dependency specification instead of NPM. ([#35])
  - Updated various dependencies to newer versions. ([#39], [#41])

    - Fixed #5 Issue - forces ids and values to strings during stateUpdate and stateUpdateMany

---
